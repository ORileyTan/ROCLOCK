# ROCLOCK

This is a ROBLOX STUDIO plugin, as such it requires ROBLOX STUDIO to run so go ahead and download it at https://www.roblox.com/download

# Some Info

This is A ROBLOX STUDIO plugin designed to tell time, that's all it does and before you click of this page this thing could serve a couple
of purposes such as remembering to do something because every quarter hour it will ring an alarm and say what time it is so you can more
effectively go onto a discord call with your friends and cook dinner. Also you can manually ask the time by clicking on the window and it
will say whatever the current time it is currently set to and it is actually grabbing time data off your BIOS chip so it's pretty accurate
unless you don't have a CMOS battery on and lost power.

# Why does the LICENSE file say that this plugin has no license
Because you can edit my plugin and put your modification of it on GitHub infact HELL ANYONE CAN just please avoid claiming that you
written the code because writing the code was hard and also some of the code I grabbed it from the devforum (A tiny amount although)
CREDITS TO screenswitch1!!!! Also adding a link to the original repo would be nice thank you!

# How do I install this thing?

Comming soon...
